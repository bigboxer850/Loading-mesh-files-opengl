Instructions to run the file

1 Paste complete the folder named TASK 2 in one place.
2 Open the project from visual studio code.
3 Remove all the main.cpp,header files,shader files from the project and reload them from the TASK folder location.
  We have to do this because the file paths saved are from previous machine.
4 Run the local windows debugger.  
5 If you want to load a different off file,then change the file[] name in main.cpp,change noVerts,noPolys,k .Then again run the file it will load new off file.
6 If the model size is very large such that it is not displaying in the window ,then in the vs file multiply the Position with small value.
